# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```


<h3>I utilised Hardhat plugins like hardhat gas reporter, hardhat coverage, and hardhat unit and staging test for this sophisticated Hardhat project, where I deployed a fundMe contract that is a crowdfunding contract. I was extremely excited about this fantastic project and learnt a lot.ğŸ¥³ğŸ¥³ğŸ¥³ğŸ¥³ğŸ¥³ğŸ¥³ğŸ¥³ğŸ¥³ğŸ¥³<h3>
